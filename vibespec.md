# Vibe Spec — MUD

## Elevator pitch

Bleak, relaxed sandbox in a hard-SF underground. No XP. No HP bar. You survive with skill, tools, and judgment.

## Core fantasy and tone

Claim a hostile earth by living within it. Scavenge, hunt, build, or farm at your pace. The world is indifferent. You adapt.

## Hard-SF world brief

High-latitude basin. A delta city drowned in mud, then locked for tens of thousands of years in permafrost. No overriding glacier. Surface is lethal cold but crossable with heavy prep. Life persists underground on chemistry, not sunlight. Players move through frozen sediments, cryopeg brines, and reinforced ruins.

**Physical logic**

* Anoxic silts sealed the city.
* Permafrost thickened hundreds of meters to >1 km.
* “Urban-mud horizon” holds collapsed floors; surviving cores give narrow vertical routes.
* Taliks and brine channels thread the freeze.
* Geothermal gradient gives mild rock temps at depth.

**Why plausible**

* Deltas bury fast; mud preserves.
* Pleistocene permafrost can persist.
* Taliks connect fluids.
* Cryopeg brines stay liquid and host microbes.
* Chemolithoautotrophs run food webs on H₂, CH₄, H₂S, NH₄⁺, Fe²⁺.
* 10–20 °C rock appears at ~1–2 km.

## Spatial structure

* **Surface:** wind-scoured steppe; whiteouts, katabatic winds. Entrances via pingo craters, thaw gullies, lake taliks, geothermal ice caves.
* **Frozen zone:** polygonal permafrost, ice wedges, small caves; mostly solid.
* **Urban-mud horizon:** tens to hundreds of meters; filled streets and buried rails. **Skyscraper highway** = stacked elevator cores and shafts, bridged with ice cribbing and buttresses.
* **Conduit zone:** taliks and brine channels as arteries; side pockets with brine lakes and gas seeps.
* **Village band:** rock at 10–20 °C; settlements carved in stiff sediments or stabilized ruins near brines; ventilation and condensate capture are constant work.
* **Hot zone:** >30 °C; short stays; geothermal vents.

## Biology and atmosphere

* Primary production is chemical. Microbial mats bloom at brine nodes.
* Bioluminescence clusters where energy flux is high.
* Air pockets vary; CO₂ and H₂S pool; CH₄ near seeps; oxygen is limited. Masks and “canaries” matter.

## Materials that endure

Urbanite concrete, brick, and glass clasts; oxidized steel; copper salts; plastiglomerates; preserved wood/textiles in cold anoxic pockets.

## Timescales

Burial 1–10 kyr. Lock-in 10–100 kyr. Habitat longevity 100 kyr–1 Myr+.

## Player role

Self-directed. No assigned purpose. Motivation is yours.

## Structure

Single player. Fully open. Each seed is a unique world. Races change the loop and risk.

## How it plays

Choose a life: roam and delve, or settle and trade. Optional life sim. Optional dungeon crawl. Keyboard and mouse. No quest rails.

## Onboarding cues

First combat exposes wounds instead of an HP bar. Leaving the safe start shows that a single floor can run for miles.

## Progression

Practice to improve. Run to run better. Use axes to master axes. No abstract HP growth. Competence and comfort increase. Weapons feel like tools, not numbers.

## Combat and injuries

Target **limbs only**: head, torso, right/left arms, right/left legs. Organs matter under the hood, not as targets. Auto-attack picks the most accurate option. Wounds bleed, break, burn, or infect. Treatment is problem → fix. Healing takes time. Death is blood loss or catastrophic trauma. Permadeath optional; saving allowed.

## Survival

Meters: hunger, thirst, sleep, temperature. Nutrition matters: protein and fat change outcomes. Darkness is constant. Fire can spread. Water can flood. Diseases exist. Gas pockets and hypoxia are live threats.

## Exploration and traversal

Floors extend for miles. No tile-by-tile Z-levels. Verticality exists via elevator cores, shafts, taliks, and brine conduits. Map remembers what you last saw. Fog and visibility vary by race. Fast travel only to places reached. Surface treks are rare, risky shortcuts between entrances.

## Races and playstyles

**Combat/Exploration**

* **Roguelike:** high regeneration; others treat you as hostile; heavy food demand.
* **Immersive Sim:** tool-forward problem solving; broad interaction affordances.

**Settle-down/Relax**

* **Cozy Farm Sim:** small mushroom person; grow crops; largely ignored if you stay in your lane.
* **Tower Defense:** ranch creatures; defend raids; breed and command an insect army.

## Weapons and tactics

Behavior by physics. Swords cut. Spears pierce hides and reach internals. Maces bruise through armor. Each weapon has a signature ability. Shields supported. Ranged: throwing, crossbows, plant/rock-powered musket.

## Building, crafting, and farming

Hands-on base building. Alter terrain. Place walls. Light crafting. Farming, fishing, and breeding supported. Focus is living, not recipe trees.

## NPCs, factions, and economy

Settlements are simple and mostly static. **Baseline reputation is race-based.** Individual reputation exists with sentient NPCs. Trade, access, and treatment change by who you are and what you did. Companions and pets exist. Worker systems limited, with more depth for the tower-defense race.

## Difficulty and failure

Tough but readable. Knowledge beats twitch. Unfair hits can happen both ways. No difficulty slider. Start race/kit/location sets run tone.

## Aesthetic

ASCII-first with bring-your-own tiles. UI states outcomes and status. Minimal music.

## Platforms and performance

PC first. Windows targeted. Linux possible. Keyboard and mouse only. 60 FPS at 1080p as floor.

## Meta

Seeds enabled. No meta unlocks. No online features beyond seeds. No photo mode planned. Mod support is a maybe.

## Design constraints

**Keep grounded:** no intact skyscrapers under ice; big caverns are rare in mud; large rooms tie to reinforced atria or ice-buttressed voids; lateral travel favors ruin layers and stiff zones.
**Hand-wave lightly:** cathedral-scale spaces tied to specific reinforced structures or vaulted rock; bright glow only at brine nodes and vents.

## Team vocabulary

* **Urban-mud horizon:** the buried city layer.
* **Skyscraper highway:** stacked elevator cores used as main shaft.
* **Talik:** unfrozen conduit through permafrost.
* **Cryopeg:** subzero brine pocket.
* **Village band:** depth with human-comfortable rock temperatures.
